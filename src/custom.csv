# note: keep that font start address written in extra_script.py, and the address written above, are in sync.
# note: PlatformIO run --target=uploadfs seems to upload filesystem image to the last partition which has 
#       Type=data and SubType=spiffs. SubType=littlefs is already defined in IDF, but PlatformIO's platform builder
#       script (builder/main.py) only checks partition subtype of "fat" or "spiffs" inside this CSV at this point.

# TODO: take the address automatically from the csv file
